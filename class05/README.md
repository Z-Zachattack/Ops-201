## About this program:
### Loopy.sh
Loopy is a hungy script, make sure to feed it as many PIDs as you can. If you don't have enough non-vital operations working, make sure to run the other script first.
### idle.sh
'idle.sh' is a simple script for feeding Loopy. It lets you know that it is running by publishing its PID at normal intervals. It is highly recommended to add an '&' in the execution `bash idle.sh &` or `bash <file/folders/idle.sh> &`
