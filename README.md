## Ops 201

What is this repo all about?\
Ops-201 Repo is a collection of small scripts and powershells designed for cyberprofessionals\
Why are you learning these skills?\
I am currently seeking employment in the cybersecurity realm, specifically regarding AI.\
What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?\
I learned snitches get stitches\
What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?\
My favorite Ops Challenge was from class 053, "Loopy". Not only did I get to engage in some harder coding loops, but I got to give my program some "attitude."\
How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?\
I have already created an update script that uses a few loops, permissions, and self-replication to search for updates in linux and apply them without user input. \
What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?\
Loopy for sure. I learned that undertale used a lot of if/for loops for the decision trees of characters. I would like to explore that more.\
What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?\
I would really like to decrease the keystrokes used in my scripts. I know there are more efficient ways of coding some of these scripts.\
